## `amazon-cnn.py`
Builds a 3-layer convolutional neural network that classifies an input image with multiple labels. Input images are fed as input in the form of a row of pixel values.

## `chunky.py`
Helper function for our 3-layer CNN. Feeds images into CNN in batches of 500.

## `joinLabel.py`
Converts an image (.jpg) into a .csv of pixel values while appending the appropiate set of labels for that image.
