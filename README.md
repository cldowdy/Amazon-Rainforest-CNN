There is no class on Monday or Wednesday (Bacc days). However, I would like this assignment to be due on Friday (5/5). It should not be a great load, and it overlaps with individual Assignment08. Assignment08 should not be a great load either and is due on Sunday night (4/30). 

In Assignment09 I would like you to read Kaggle Amazon data (on dsgpu01 at /gpudata/kaggle/amazon) into TensorFlow. I want each group to submit code to do so on one group branch.

On Friday (5/5) I would like each group to give a short presentation on (1) how they imported the data, (2) description of the data, and (3) a proposed plan on attacking the problem.
