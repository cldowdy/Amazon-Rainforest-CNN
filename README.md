# Understanding the Amazon from Space

Experts estimate that the world loses 48 football fields of forest every minute. With that in mind the Amazon rainforest represents a substantial portion of the worlds forests. 

[Planet](https://www.planet.com/company/), open-sourced roughly 54Gb of satellite imagery taken over the Amazon rainforest. The goal was simple: use the satellite data to track the human footprint in the Amazon rainforest. 

This repostitory documents my use of TensorFlow to build a 3-layer convolutional neural network to classify satellite imagery.
